				Introduction to Network Programming in Python
		==============================================================
=>The purpose of Network Programming in Python is that "To share the data or information between multiple 
    devices across the globe."
--------------------------------
=>Definition of Network:
--------------------------------
=>A Network is a Collection of Inter-connected Autonomous Computers connected with Server and data or Information can be exchanged.
----------------------------------
=>In Network Programming, we develop Two Types of Programs. They are
			1. Server Side Application
			2. Client Side Application
-----------------------------------------------------
Definition of Server Side Application
-----------------------------------------------------
=>A Server Side Application is one , which always receives the Request from Client Side Application, Process the Request of Client Side Application and gives Response back to Client Side Application.
-----------------------------------------------------
Definition of Client Side Application
-----------------------------------------------------
=>A Client Side Application is one, which always makes a Request to the server side application and gets the result from server side application.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Definition of DNS (Domain Naming Service)
-------------------------------------------------------------
=>DNS is nothing but Name of the Physical Machine where Server Side Application Resides
=>The Defautl DNS of Every Computer is "localhost".
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition of IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>An IP Address is nothing but Address of Physical Machine where Server Side Application Resides.
=>The Defautl IP Address of Every Computer is "127.0.0.1" (also called as Loop Back Address).
-------------------------------------------------------------
Definition of Portno 
-------------------------------------------------------------
A Port Number is one fo the Logical Numerical ID where Server Side Application Runs.
-------------------------------------------------------------
=>Hence If any Client Side Program want to get connection from server side application then Client Siode Program must pass ( DNS , Portno )   OR (IP Address, portno)
---------------------------------
Definition of socket
---------------------------------
A socket is a Bi-Directional Communication component  between Two Ends
